# stock-price-prediction
YET TO BE FINISHED!!!
This project predicts future stock prices using simple time-series techniques like Moving Averages and ARIMA. The goal is to learn how stock trends work, load real financial data, and build a basic forecasting model. The project uses Python and Yahoo Finance data for analysis and visualization. This is a learning project, not a real trading system.
